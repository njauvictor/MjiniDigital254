      Businesses lose 20–30% of revenue due to poor inventory management (<a href="https://hbr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">Harvard Business Review</a>).

Our AI-powered inventory systems are built to eliminate these inefficiencies through automation, predictive analytics, and database intelligence.  

    <br /><br />
    Built using <strong>Convex DB</strong> and modern frameworks like <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>, our systems track stock movements across warehouses, branches, and outlets in real time with <strong>99.9% accuracy</strong>. Smart barcode scanning reduces counting time by <strong>80%</strong>, while AI-driven forecasting predicts demand with <strong>95% accuracy</strong>—minimizing overstocking and preventing costly stockouts.  

    <br /><br />
    Nairobi retailers using our solution report a <strong>35% reduction in carrying costs</strong> and a <strong>25% increase in sales</strong> through optimized replenishment cycles. The system integrates seamlessly with <strong>QuickBooks, Xero, and Zoho Books</strong> for synchronized financial management. Predictive reordering algorithms ensure that high-demand products are automatically restocked before they run out, while low-turnover items are flagged to prevent capital lockup.  

    <br /><br />
    With integrated dashboards powered by <strong>AI analytics</strong>, managers can visualize performance, detect trends, and make instant decisions. By combining automation, database precision, and AI-driven forecasting, we help Kenyan wholesalers, distributors, and retailers gain real-time visibility, operational control, and business growth.
